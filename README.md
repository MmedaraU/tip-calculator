## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass/SCSS
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### My experience

Finally completed this using a tutorial, though I changed some things based on what I have learnt on my own.

Got to practice interpolation
```Js
tipPerPerson.innerText = `$${0.0.toFixed(2)}`;
```
This project helped me see what I could achieve with what I've learnt so far. Back to learning.

### Continued development

I want to try building my next project without a tutorial. 

### Useful resources

- [Brad Traversy JS Crash Course for Beginners]() - One of the resources I've been using to learn JS.
